this is a project based on the PCB defect detection using Federate learning Neural Network . the dataset is used from the Kaggle containing the 6 type of the defects. i  got accuracy of 86.5% in train the dataset shown in the project model.
This is a project based on the PCB defect detection using Federate learning Neural Network done under the guidanc of the Dr. hariharan Muthusamy (Associate Professor NIT uk ). the dataset is used from the kaggle containing the 6 type of the defects. i got accuracy of 86.5% in train the dataset shon in the project . the dataset contains the images file along with the annotation file containg the coordinate for the images . the images are cut using the same coordinates with using python . and after that the model is prepared thorugh the dataset . the model is been test and trained with different optimizer using the cnn model .
the dataset containing the 6 client for the training set with 6 type of defects with a central server model . the model is trained with the 100 epoch which communicates the sever each time it trains the data .
